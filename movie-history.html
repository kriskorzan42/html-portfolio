    <h2>The Silent Era (1895-1927)</h2>
    <p>Silent films dominated the early years of cinema, with masterpieces like "The Great Train Robbery" (1903) and Charlie Chaplin's works. Directors developed innovative visual storytelling techniques to compensate for the lack of sound.</p>

    <h2>The Golden Age of Hollywood (1927-1960s)</h2>
    <p>Following "The Jazz Singer" (1927), the first successful sound film, Hollywood entered its Golden Age. This period saw the rise of major studios and the establishment of the star system, producing classics like "Gone with the Wind" (1939) and "Casablanca" (1942).</p>

    <h2>The New Hollywood Era (1960s-1980s)</h2>
    <p>A new generation of filmmakers including Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg revolutionized cinema. This era produced some of the most influential films, including "The Godfather" (1972) and "Jaws" (1975).</p>

    <h2>The Digital Revolution (1990s-Present)</h2>
    <p>Digital technology transformed filmmaking, with "Toy Story" (1995) becoming the first fully computer-animated feature film. CGI has become increasingly prevalent, enabling films like "Avatar" (2009) to create entirely new worlds.</p>
